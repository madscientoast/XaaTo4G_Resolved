XaaTo4G CMS Analysis Code

## Core
Core contains the main analysis code. Every plot that isn't limit setting is done here. 
(i.e. all pairing and cut analysis code is here). 

## Limits
Everythiing we need to get to limit setting is here. 
Model has the scripts to get workspace files.
We take those to run COMBINE.
Then we take COMBINE JSON files to the JSON scripts to get cross section limits. 

Then just run the limits script to get the limit plot.
